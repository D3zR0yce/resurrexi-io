## Core Thesis

**Perfect hedging is mathematically impossible** in incomplete markets (Harrison-Kreps 1979). Yet financial institutions sell "protection" at premium prices. This paper explores the gap between theoretical impossibility and marketed completeness.

## Three-Part Framework

### 1. Theoretical Impossibility

- **Incomplete Markets:** Not every contingent claim can be replicated
- **Basis Risk:** Hedges correlate imperfectly with underlying exposures
- **Liquidity Risk:** Market disruptions invalidate hedge assumptions
- **Counterparty Risk:** Protection seller may default when needed most

### 2. Market Microstructure

- **Rent Extraction:** Partial hedging sold as complete protection
- **Necessity Taxes:** Systemic risk makes hedging mandatory (regulatory requirements)
- **Information Asymmetry:** Sophisticated actors exploit less-informed counterparties
- **Concentrated Supply:** Few providers → oligopoly pricing

### 3. Offshore Finance as Arbitrage

- **Regulatory Arbitrage:** Offshore structures bypass domestic hedging requirements
- **Tax Optimization:** Cross-border flows minimize effective tax rates
- **Opacity:** Complex structures obscure ultimate beneficiaries
- **Consent Deficits:** (Link to DoCS framework) - stakeholders excluded from governance

## Empirical Agenda

**Phase 2:** Quantify rent extraction
- CDS spreads vs actual default rates
- Hedge effectiveness metrics across asset classes
- Offshore premium vs onshore equivalent structures

**Phase 3:** Causal inference
- Bloomberg Terminal analysis
- Regulatory event studies
- Network analysis of offshore ownership

## Connections to Adversarial Systems

- **Finance as Adversarial Environment:** Competing interests (hedger vs dealer, onshore vs offshore)
- **Friction Dynamics:** Incomplete markets generate persistent misalignment
- **Stakes Heterogeneity:** Systemic institutions vs retail investors

## Materials

- **51 pages, ~60 references**
- **File:** 397K PDF
