## Core Thesis

Trauma is not "broken" psychology—it's **maladaptive learning from bad training data**. Just as ML models trained on corrupted datasets develop pathological patterns, humans exposed to adversarial environments during development encode suboptimal strategies.

## Four Categories of Bad Training Data

1. **Direct Negative Examples:** Extreme penalties in early training (abuse, violence, threats)
2. **Indirect Negative Examples:** Noisy/contradictory signals (unpredictable caregivers, gaslighting)
3. **Absent Positive Examples:** Class imbalance (neglect, emotional unavailability)
4. **Insufficient Exposure:** Limited dataset size (isolated nuclear families)

## Computational Validation

PyTorch experiments demonstrating:

- **1,247× gradient cascade** during adversarial training
- **Weight instability** with high-magnitude parameter oscillations
- **Overfitting:** Training loss 0.031 → test loss 2.847 (p=0.0012, Cohen's d=3.08)
- **Catastrophic forgetting:** New learning destroys previous stable patterns

## Nuclear Families as Limited Datasets

- Small training corpus (2-4 primary examples)
- No regularization (no external oversight)
- Prone to overfitting parental dysfunction
- Lack of diversity in relationship models

## Implications

- **Clinical:** Reframes therapy as model fine-tuning, not "fixing brokenness"
- **Policy:** Advocates for expanded social infrastructure (childcare, community support)
- **Research:** Novel interdisciplinary framework bridging ML, neuroscience, developmental psych

## Materials

- **39 pages, 71 references**
- **4 review agents validated** (technical, clinical, writing, novelty) - all GO
- **Paper DOI:** 10.5281/zenodo.17681336
- **Code DOI:** 10.5281/zenodo.17681161
- **Next:** PsyArXiv submission (may need condensed context for psych audience)
