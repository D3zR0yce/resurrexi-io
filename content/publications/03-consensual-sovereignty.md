abstract: "Stakes-weighted consent alignment framework operationalizing political legitimacy. 7 minimal axioms → 3 theorems (consent-holding necessity, inevitable friction, minimal absolutism). Monte Carlo validation across 4 dynamic mechanisms showing 98.5% friction reduction and monotonic convergence in 87.1% of runs."

**Version:** v1.0.1 (completed November 2025)

## Core Framework

**Legitimacy** operationalized as:

```
L = w₁·α + w₂·P
```

Where:
- **α** = stakes-weighted consent alignment
- **P** = procedural fairness
- **F** = friction (misalignment cost)

## Minimal Axiomatic Foundation

**7 Axioms:**
1. Stakes heterogeneity (different impacts on different people)
2. Voice ≠ stakes (voting power may not reflect consequences)
3. Consent is measurable (preferences can be quantified)
4. Friction is costly (misalignment has real consequences)
5. Learning is possible (agents update beliefs)
6. No perfect information (uncertainty exists)
7. Stability preference (change has transition costs)

**→ 3 Theorems:**
1. **Consent-holding necessity:** Legitimacy requires stakeholder consent
2. **Inevitable friction:** Perfect alignment impossible under heterogeneity
3. **Minimal absolutism:** Unilateral authority limited to consent-preserving domains

## Computational Validation

Monte Carlo simulations (1000 runs × 50 periods) across 4 mechanisms:

- **Stakes-weighted DoCS:** α=0.872, F=1.6 (98.5% friction reduction)
- **Monotonic convergence:** 87.1% of runs show consistent improvement
- **Bayesian learning:** Agents update based on outcomes
- **Social learning:** Information diffusion improves coordination

## Applications

- **Algorithmic Governance:** AI decision-making with stakeholder consent
- **Climate Negotiations:** Emissions policy balancing development vs environment
- **Corporate Governance:** Stakeholder capitalism frameworks
- **International Relations:** Treaty design and compliance mechanisms
